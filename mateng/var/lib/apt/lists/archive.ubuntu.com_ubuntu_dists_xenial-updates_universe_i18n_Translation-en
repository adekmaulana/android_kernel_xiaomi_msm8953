 you to control pitch, duration, and repetitions. Its job is to live inside
 shell/perl scripts and allow more granularity than one has otherwise. It is
 controlled completely through command line options. It's not supposed to be
 complex, and it isn't - but it makes system monitoring (or whatever else it
 gets hacked into) much more informative.

Package: biber
Description-md5: 2145fae4f6a6ba45840729fab8ef9657
Description-en: Much-augmented BibTeX replacement for BibLaTeX users
 The biblatex package by Philipp Lehman is becoming the definitive
 citation management tool for LaTeX users. Biblatex has relied on the
 venerable BibTeX program only for sorting and generating a very
 generic .bbl file without any formatting instruction. Everything else
 is taken care of by biblatex, which provides a powerful and flexible
 macro interface for authors of citation styles.
 .
 Biber offers a large superset of BibTeX functionality for BibLaTeX
 users. In addition it offers full UTF-8 (Unicode 6.0) capabilities,
 fully customisable sorting, output to GraphViz to help visualise
 complex crossrefs, support for remote data sources, structural
 validation of the data against the (customisable) data model, and a
 lot more.

 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every

 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.

 It consists of a pair of programs:
 .
 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.
 .
 chronyc: This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within
 the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

Package: cloud-initramfs-growroot
Description-md5: 2a0d4bed7bada9873cf69d658abe0c23
Description-en: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Description-en: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 With this package installed, the GraphicsMagick command line tools can
 be executed like their ImageMagick counterparts. It allows one to migrate
 scripts from ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick without any code changes.

Package: graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat
Description-md5: 9f57ab3d18417d8eacccdce6026304cc
Description-en: image processing libraries providing ImageMagick interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

 segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and
 classifying data found in a digitally sampled
 representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image
 acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI
 scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
 correspondences between data. For example, in the medical
 environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to
 combine the information contained in both.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings.

 The goals of the kBuild framework:
  - Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
  - Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing ad-hoc
    solutions.
  - Makefile can very simple to write and maintain.
 .
 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
  - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
  - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
    simplification.
  - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
  - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well
 use the full GNU package.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).
 .
 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description-md5: 94da985e07c2397fc71a3f86ec4da7dd
Description-en: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Package: libfuzzer-6.0-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Package: libgraphics-magick-perl
Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Package: libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0
Description-md5: 135e6af8928a435cce371d420101ce63
Description-en: GStreamer development files for libraries from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.
 .
 This package contains shared GStreamer libraries from the "bad" set. The API
 is not guaranteed to be stable.

Description-md5: 7727e410aa3baa784cb47a4afb95f4e8
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, OCaml bindings
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.

 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description-en: Terminal-emulator State Machine - development
 TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal
 emulators. It tries to support all common standards while keeping
 compatibility to existing emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, ..
 .
 TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management.
 It is a simple plain state machine without any external dependencies.
 It can be used to implement terminal emulators, but also to implement
 other applications that need to interpret terminal escape sequences.
 .
 This library is very similar to libvte of the gnome project.
 However, libvte is highly bound to GTK+, which makes it unsuitable for
 non-graphics projects that need to parse escape sequences. Instead,
 TSM tries to restrict its API to terminal emulation only. Furthermore,
 TSM does not try to establish a new terminal emulation standard, but
 instead keeps compatibility as close to xterm as possible.
 This is why the TERM variable can be set to xterm-color256 with any
 TSM based terminal emulator.

Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Package: llvm-3.9
Description-md5: e971ae25bca86cd8f4914ecf62f6301c
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Package: lsb-core
Description-md5: 390d8738603a81a9f136aad6064a4b28
Description-en: Linux Standard Base core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of the core of the Linux Standard
 Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64 (Itanium), IBM S390, and
 PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux kernel. Future revisions of the
 specification and this package may support the LSB on additional
 architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its
 presence does not imply that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

Package: lsb-invalid-mta
Description-md5: 33de1113b88f03d989868cbc67ba462c
Description-en: Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a desktop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.

Package: munge
Description-md5: 717b7e390379bf5e96112b0ce25b8486
Description-en: authentication service to create and validate credentials
 MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service
 for creating and validating credentials.  It allows a process
 to authenticate the UID and GID of another local or remote
 process within a group of hosts having common users and groups.
 These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a shared
 cryptographic key.
 .
 A process creates a credential by requesting one from the local
 MUNGE service.  The encoded credential contains the UID and GID
 of the originating process.  This process sends the credential to
 another process within the security realm as a means of proving its
 identity.  The receiving process validates the credential with the
 use of its local MUNGE service.  The decoded credential provides
 the receiving process with a reliable means of ascertaining the
 UID and GID of the originating process, and this information can
 be used for accounting or access control decisions.
 .
 Clients can create and validate these credentials without the use
 of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific methods.

 This package is a complement to the generic popularity-contest
 package to enable anonymous submission of usage statistics to
 NeuroDebian in addition to the popcon submissions to the underlying
 distribution (either Debian or Ubuntu) popcon server.
 .
 Participating in popcon is important for the following reasons:
  * Popular packages receive more attention from developers; bugs are
    fixed faster and updates are provided quicker.
  * It ensures that support is not dropped for a previous release of
    Debian or Ubuntu while there are active users.
  * User statistics may be useful for upstream research software
    developers seeking funding for continued development.
 .
 This requires that popcon is activated for the underlying distribution
 (Debian or Ubuntu), which can be achieved by running
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest" as root.

 Once the system time gets corrected, the plugin can detect it and verify the
 lifetimes of all certificates used for active tunnels. If any certificate in
 the trust-chain is not valid for the given system time, the tunnel gets either
 closed or reestablished.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks.

Package: tenshi
Description-md5: bca1e1d99b2be724185f9beefa4984ee
Description-en: log monitoring and reporting tool
 Tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files
 for lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches.
 The regular expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval
 and a list of mail recipients.
 .
 Queues can be set to send a notification as soon as there is a log line
 assigned to it, or to send periodic reports.
 .
 Additionally, uninteresting fields in the log lines (such as PID numbers) can
 be masked with the standard regular expression grouping operators ( ).
 This allows cleaner and more readable reports. All reports are separated by
 hostname and all messages are condensed when possible.
 .
 The program reads a configuration file and then forks a daemon for monitoring
 the specified log files.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be

Description-en: View-OS in user space - ext2 module for UMFUSE
 View-OS is a novel approach to the process/kernel interface.  The semantics of
 each system call can be assigned process by process giving the user the right
 to decide which view of the system each process has to join.  Each process can
 "see" a different file system structure, networking resources, processor,
 devices.  Moreover some of the resources can be provided by the user
 him/herself, thus these resource can be private to the single process and are
 not known a priori by the system.  Groups of processes can share the same view
 but this is just an optimization to share management methods.
 .
 For more information, see http://wiki.virtualsquare.org
 .
 UMView is a user-mode implementation of View-OS.  Processes are run with a
 controlling daemon that captures all the system calls (at present using the
 ptrace() system call) and uses dynamically loadable modules to change their
 semantic.
 .
 This package contains a sub-module for umfuse.  umfuse is contained in the

 modules.  umfuseext2 can be used to mount Extended 2 file system images
 inside an UMView instance.

Package: websockify
Description-md5: 337cbf4b14d9c875bd13ec09c109dd7e
Description-en: WebSockets support for any application/server
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.

 User attributes (username, first name, last name, display name, nickname,
 and email address) can be synchronized with your enterprise's system of
 record each time the user logs into WordPress.

 continually updated) based on any attribute Shibboleth provides. For
 example, you may decide to give users with an eduPersonAffiliation value
 of faculty the WordPress role of editor, while the eduPersonAffiliation
 value of student maps to the WordPress role contributor. Or you may choose
 to limit access to WordPress altogether using a special
 eduPersonEntitlement value.

Description-md5: 11d4a7275218ad33ccc6479463963d83
Description-en: X.Org X server -- VIA display driver
 OpenChrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers
 for the VIA UniChrome video chipsets.
 .
 Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an
 experimental branch of the unichrome cvs code, this is a continued development
 of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which
 also incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets.
 .
 Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently
 been ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if
 you wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free
 and open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver.

 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: yorick
Description-md5: b513b8d5ee0f47690595619a758fcf95
Description-en: interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.
 .
 Many add-on packages and plug-ins are available for Yorick (the
 package names begin with "yorick-"). You may want to install the
 yorick-full metapackage which depends on the vast majority of them.
