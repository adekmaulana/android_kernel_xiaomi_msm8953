Package: appstream
Description-md5: 2e965edcce1f676af5daae61436d324e
Description-en: Software component index
 AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for creating and sharing
 metadata of software components available in the package repositories
 of a distribution.
 It provides specifications for an unified software component metadata format,
 screenshot and icon services and various other metadata to describe software
 in repositories.
 The metadata can be used to show details about the actual software in software
 management tools instead of just listing packages, making software management
 intuitive and easy.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the
 AppStream database of installed and available software, and enables AppStream
 integration in APT.

 BackupPC is disk based and not tape based. This particularity allows
 features not found in any other backup solution:
  * Clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
    Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC are
    stored only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage and disk
    writes. Also known as "data deduplication".
  * Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage.
    CPU impact of compression is low since only new files (those not already
    in the pool) need to be compressed.
  * A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log files,
    configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and cancel
    backups and browse and restore files from backups very quickly.
  * No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the smb protocol is used.
    On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used
  * Flexible restore options. Single files can be downloaded from any backup
    directly from the CGI interface. Zip or Tar archives for selected files
    or directories can also be downloaded from the CGI interface.
  * BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).
  * Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel.

Package: bdf2psf
Description-md5: 5eb98031ca1e36678eeeefee0d31085b
Description-en: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

 be pushed to the server via sftp (which most SSH installations come
 with), FTP, or over a custom and faster protocol if bzr is installed in
 the remote end.
 .
 Merging in Bazaar is easy, as the implementation is able to avoid many
 spurious conflicts, deals well with repeated merges between branches,
 and is able to handle modifications to renamed files correctly.
 .
 Bazaar is written in Python, and has a flexible plugin interface which
 can be used to extend its functionality. Many plugins exist, providing
 useful commands (bzrtools), graphical interfaces (qbzr), or native
 interaction with Subversion branches (bzr-svn).
 .
 This package provides the documentation.

  * rspush: Push local changes to a remote server using rsync instead
    sftp.
  * graph-ancestry: Use graphviz to produce graphs of branch ancestry.

    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

 available locally, replacing the CUPS broadcasting/browsing which was
 dropped in CUPS 1.6.x. This way the old behavior of having the remote
 printers available automatically is now re-implemented with Bonjour.
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 client to allow the
 latter to browse the printer list of CUPS < 1.6 servers (by using the
 old 'cups' protocol in BrowseRemoteProtocols).
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 server to allow CUPS <
 1.6 clients to browse its printer list (by using the old 'cups'
 protocol in BrowseLocalProtocols).

Package: docbook-xml
Description-md5: 283ee39bcb227d4b875ce6f857e41f58
Description-en: standard XML documentation system for software and systems
 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it
 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors
 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was
 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about
 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard
 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of
 choice for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a
 selected set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including
 4.0, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

Description-en: stylesheets for processing DocBook XML to various output formats
 These are modular XSL stylesheets for processing documents composed
 with the DocBook XML DTD and its derivatives ("Simplified" DocBook
 XML, JRefEntry DTD, etc.).
 .
 The stylesheets provide XSLT transformations for (X)HTML, WordML, HTML Help,
 JavaHelp, Man page (nroff), Website, Eclipse Platform Help file and XSL
 Formatting Object (XSL-FO) output. The latter can be further processed to
 a number of print formats using FOP or TeX-based tools.
 .
 The stylesheets are modular in the sense that you can extend and, to some
 extent, customize them. The documentation is included in a separate package.

Package: eatmydata
Description-md5: 4dad1280628a46c312954a4d1ba76a96
Description-en: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

 The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia

 Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF) were

 running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one
 of these smart font technologies.

Package: fonts-sil-nuosusil
Description-md5: d6ea72c7c14321fad5939a643e9354f8
Description-en: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.

Description-en: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,

 Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share
    common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes.
    As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically

Package: grep
Description-md5: f9188c5583d41955f3b3fe60b9d445f1
Description-en: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Package: lftp
Description-md5: a4340506ec33e727d20a43b185d30cc6
Description-en: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP/BitTorrent client programs
 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS,
 FTPS and BitTorrent protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing
 set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive
 tool for downloading files.

 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.

 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description-en: Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost System library provides simple, light-weight error_code
 objects that encapsulate system-specific error code values, yet also
 provide access to more abstract and portable error conditions via
 error_condition objects. Because error_code objects can represent
 errors from sources other than the operating system, including
 user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an
 associated error_category.

Description-en: Apache Commons Collections - Extended Collections API for Java
 The Java Collections Framework was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It added many
 powerful data structures that accelerate development of most significant Java
 applications. Since that time it has become the recognised standard for
 collection handling in Java.
 .
 Commons Collections seek to build upon the JDK classes by providing new
 interfaces, implementations and utilities. There are many features, including:
 .
  * Bag interface for collections that have a number of copies of each object
  * BidiMap interface for maps that can be looked up from value to key as well
    and key to value
  * MapIterator interface to provide simple and quick iteration over maps
  * Transforming decorators that alter each object as it is added to the
    collection
  * Composite collections that make multiple collections look like one
  * Ordered maps and sets that retain the order elements are added in,
    including an LRU based map
  * Reference map that allows keys and/or values to be garbage collected under
    close control
  * Many comparator implementations
  * Many iterator implementations
  * Adapter classes from array and enumerations to collections
  * Utilities to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections
    such as union, intersection, and closure

Description-en: magical config file parser
 Config::Auto allows developers to parse config files without
 needing to specify the format of the file (though they can do it).
 .
 It even looks for the config file in standard places (working dir,
 home dir, /etc) and tries some common config file names if the path
 isn't specified in the call.
 .
 It then determines the format of the config file, parses it and then
 returns a data structure containing the configuration data. The format
 of this structure depends on the format of the file.
 .
 At the moment, libconfig-auto-perl knows about colon, space and equals
 separated, XML, Perl, Windows INI, BIND9 and irssi style config files,
 though files in BIND9 or irssi format cannot be parsed.

 inspired by the well known Apache configuration format, in fact, this
 module is fully capable of parsing Apache configurations, but the
 output is not usable by Apache. You can also just use simple name/value
 pairs in your configuration files.

 In addition to the capabilities of an Apache configuration file it
 supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments and
 multi-line options.

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 56ab0dbfeb69a085703b46539790f388
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

 Galois Field arithmetic forms the backbone of erasure-coded storage systems,
 most famously the Reed-Solomon erasure code. A Galois Field is defined over
 w-bit words and is termed GF(2w). As such, the elements of a Galois Field are
 the integers 0, 1, . . ., 2^w − 1. Galois Field arithmetic defines addition
 and multiplication over these closed sets of integers in such a way that they
 work as you would hope they would work. Specifically, every number has a
 unique multiplicative inverse. Moreover, there is a value, typically the value
 2, which has the property that you can enumerate all of the non-zero elements
 of the field by taking that value to successively higher powers.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to build against the shared

 The OpenGL Extension Wrangler, GLEW for short, is a library that
 handles initialization of OpenGL extensions in a portable and simple
 way. Once the program initializes the library and checks the
 availability of extensions, it can safely call the entry points defined
 by the extension. Currently GLEW supports almost all the extensions
 found in the OpenGL extension registry (http://www.opengl.org/registry).

Package: libglm-dev
Description-md5: 8481f3d0f0d4f49f42598ace739888b7
Description-en: C++ library for OpenGL GLSL type-based mathematics
 OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics
 software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification.
 .
 GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same
 naming conventions and functionalities as GLSL, so that when a programmer
 knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, which makes it really easy to use.
 .
 This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the
 GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix
 transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, et cetera.
 .
 This library works perfectly together with OpenGL but it also ensures
 interoperability with other third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good
 candidate for software rendering (such as raytracing, rasterisation), image
 processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and
 convenient mathematics library.

 The API presented by this module is a mildly object oriented
 reinterpretation of the C API, where opaque C structures are
 Perl objects, but the style of function call has been left
 mostly untouched.  As a result, most routines modify one or
 more of the parameters passed to them, reflecting the C
 call-by-reference (or call-by-value-return) semantics.

 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Package: libhttp-daemon-perl
Description-md5: 86a26579760d05601c918d89642d3431
Description-en: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Package: libhttp-date-perl
Description-md5: 9785d548badb18b00824a00956a6e270

 HTTP::Date provides functions that deal the date formats used by the HTTP
 protocol (and then some more). Only the first two functions, time2str() and
 str2time(), are exported by default.

Package: libhttp-message-perl
Description-md5: d0d09bc69619d7907570bf158f4d4197
Description-en: perl interface to HTTP style messages
 The HTTP::Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the
 messages passed in HTTP style communication. These are classes representing
 requests, responses and the headers contained within them.
 .
 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

 LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that
 provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
 .
 Features:
  * Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.
  * Data is stored sorted by key.
  * Callers can provide a custom comparison function to override
    the sort order.
  * The basic operations are Put(key,value), Get(key), Delete(key).
  * Multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch.
  * Users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of
    data.
  * Forward and backward iteration is supported over the data.
  * Data is automatically compressed using the Snappy compression
    library.
  * External activity (file system operations etc.) is relayed through
    a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system
    interactions.
  * Detailed documentation about how to use the library is included with
    the source code.
 .
 Limitations:
  * This is not a SQL database. It does not have a relational data model,
    it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.
  * Only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a
    particular database at a time.
  * There is no client-server support builtin to the library.
    An application that needs such support will have to wrap their own
    server around the library.

Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems - library
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.
 .
 This package contains the static library for developing programs using
 liblpsolve.

Description-en: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors

Package: liblwp-mediatypes-perl
Description-md5: 39f3a89fb73f99e7871809c2c0d8f938
Description-en: module to guess media type for a file or a URL
 LWP::MediaTypes provides functions for handling media (also known as MIME)
 types and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is
 defined by the media.types file. If the ~/.media.types file exists it is used
 instead. For backwards compatibility it will also look for ~/.mime.types.

Package: liblwp-protocol-https-perl
Description-md5: 535f9e50e5b283e9fd71fec3f0a43cd8
Description-en: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description-en: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.

 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.

Package: libsnappy1v5
Description-md5: 87a4defa5f66a7f4af2eb47bb53fe942
Description-en: fast compression/decompression library
 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
 maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
 library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
 compression.
 .
 For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description-md5: 1d62424e8724202d89f9a9fadad8266e
Description-en: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description-en: base class for SAX drivers and filters
 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main
 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie
 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.

 basic SAX2 events should be available.

Package: libxml-sax-perl
Description-md5: 85b6ca7554a3537b49500d73d818d9b6
Description-en: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Package: libxml-simple-perl
Description-md5: 9205d4b838f0b9ba0b4731da4e97a76d

 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.

Package: libxml-twig-perl
Description-md5: 57b0c694882ee9f6f587f4f1a19451b2
Description-en: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Package: libxml-xpathengine-perl
Description-md5: a232570871d958cf3696105e6607e9a0
Description-en: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description-en: Perl interface to libyaml, a YAML implementation
 YAML::LibYAML (or YAML::XS) is a Perl interface to Kirill Siminov's libyaml
 library, a YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) implementation written in C to
 support the YAML 1.1 specification. The provided Dump and Load routines
 are compatible with the Perl YAML module (see libyaml-perl).

Package: libyaml-perl
Description-md5: 207c6e42686e3356a6c6e3a975e92075
Description-en: YAML Ain't Markup Language
 YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for human
 readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most modern
 programming languages (including Perl, of course). YAML supports Unicode
 and there are implementations of the parser in many different languages,
 making it a rather portable serialization format.
 .
 Please note that the YAML module is currently a deprecated implementation
 in Pure Perl, which is probably slow on your system. The authors intend
 to change it to just be a front-end interface module for various YAML
 implementations. For now, YAML::Any is a module provided for this purpose,
 which simply selects the best YAML implementation available.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: 6b4785760a94a8fe2cbd5b23bbfb906b
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.7.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.
 .
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.

Package: logrotate
Description-md5: bb73169bb75b2b8a2fda1453d214416d
Description-en: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.

Package: logtail
Description-md5: d3d40f9e26c6029e962576fe56693f04
Description-en: Print log file lines that have not been read
 This program will read in a standard text file and create an
 offset marker when it reads the end. The offset marker is read
 the next time logtail is run and the text file pointer is moved
 to the offset location. This allows logtail to read in the next
 lines of data following the marker. This is good for marking log
 files for automatic log file checkers to monitor system events.
 .
 The package also provides logtail2, which better deals with rotated log
 files: If logtail2 finds that the inode of the file was changed, it assumes
 that the log has been rotated, and tries to find the file it was rotated to
 using heuristic plugins. If it finds the file, it will print the remainder of
 the file starting at the offset saved to the offset file. If a file with the
 correct inode was not found, logtail2 will only print the new file in its
 entirety before writing a new offset file.

Package: logwatch
Description-md5: ece539a8a87c5f861d7f0b865e42a03c
Description-en: log analyser with nice output written in Perl
 Logwatch is a modular log analyser that runs every night
 and mails you the results. It can also be run from command line.
 .
 The output is by service and you can limit the output to one particular
 service. The subscripts which are responsible for the output, mostly
 convert the raw log lines in structured format.
 .
 Logwatch generally ignores the time component in the output, that means,
 you will know that the reported event was logged in the requested range of
 time, but you will have to go to the raw log files to get the exact details.

Package: lp-solve
Description-md5: bc9fbd53b2b145f26b30729410336710
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

 the dynamic library calls which are called by
 the executed process and the signals received by that process.
 It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.

 MAAS controls the servers through IPMI or another BMC or  converged chassis
 controller such as Cisco UCS. It provides a full inventory  of components,
 and can install Ubuntu, CentOS or Windows very fast on any  server under
 its control. It can also track and provide DHCP and DNS for other devices
 on the network.
 .
 MAAS handles VLANs and fabrics that span many trunked switches, as well as
 the routing-centric infrastructure typically used for large-scale OpenStack
 or other scale-out deployments. MAAS manages IP addresses and provides APIs
 for address assignment and release. MAAS can also allocate IP addresses for
 containers on machines, and release them when the machine is repurposed. MAAS
 provides PXE, DHCP, DNS and other low-level  services to ensure the cluster
 works smoothly.
 .
 MAAS works with any configuration system, and is recommended by the teams
 behind both Chef and Juju as a physical provisioning system.

Description-en: Rack Controller for MAAS
 The MAAS rack controller (maas-rackd) provides highly available, fast
 and local broadcast services to the machines provisioned by MAAS. You
 need a MAAS rack controller attached to each fabric (which is a set of
 trunked switches). You can attach multiple rack controllers to these
 physical networks for high availability, with secondary rack controllers
 automatically stepping to provide these services if the primary rack
 controller fails.
 .
 A common configuration is to have a rack controller in each rack, with
 a fast primary network interface to the rack switch and secondary
 network interfaces on one or two other nearby racks for high
 availability redundancy.
 .
 This package depends on the necessary components to provide iSCSI,
 DHCP, TFTP and power management.

Package: maas-region-controller
Description-md5: 0e57a8fda20f945ee0eadf3b35b89057
Description-en: Region Controller for MAAS
 The MAAS region controller (maas-regiond) is the REST API server for
 all MAAS clients, and the postgres database that maintains machine
 state for the entire data centre (or “region”). The region controller
 an be scaled-out and highly available given the appropriate postgres
 setup and additional API servers.
 .
 This package installs the postgres database and the API server, so it
 is appropriate for the initial installation of a new MAAS region. To
 scale out the controller or make it highly available, install
 maas-region-controller-api on additional servers and ensure the
 postgres database is HA too.

Package: mlocate
Description-md5: 34e9c00f37885dbcdfb61296f24c84df
Description-en: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Package: pax
Description-md5: 7f236f6351e1536c2153e84c93563932
Description-en: Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)
 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads
 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended
 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used
 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The
 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in
 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but
 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.
 .
 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats
 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and
 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions
 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,
 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the
 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing
 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing
 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable
 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.
 .
 Note that ACLs and Extended Attributes are not supported.
 Also, on Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/Linux (but not
 Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), size of archive members is limited
 to the width of the "long" type, that is, 2 GiB on platforms
 that do not have a 64-bit "long" type, due to a bug in the
 GNU C library (Debian #317466).

Package: pbuilder
Description-md5: a8198b8566f5ca30b1c95b4df04af8ce
Description-en: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot.
 It is an ideal system to use to check
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

 later, replacing the old pcmcia-cs tools used with earlier kernel versions.
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities
 such as network connections, modems, increased memory, etc.
 .
 To use PCMCIA you need to have kernel modules available to support
 it. These are included in the stock Debian 2.6 kernel packages. You
 will most likely also need udev, although it isn't always required.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is required by many wireless network adapters.

Description-en: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Package: perl-base

Description-en: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.22' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.22') instead.

Package: pinentry-curses
Description-md5: 40c3b46e5e326523fcd237c6508519bf
Description-en: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Package: pinentry-doc
Description-md5: 0434c9b9c7b30b4ad8103242894faa4e
Description-en: documentation for pinentry packages
 This package contains the documentation for the pinentry packages,
 a suite of programs that allow secure entry of PINs or pass phrases.
 If you have one of the pinentry packages installed then you may want
 to install this package as well, but the documentation mostly concerns
 the internal protocol and is therefore not necessary for the casual
 user.

Package: pinentry-gnome3
Description-md5: 812db39c5b4e9693cee922f69dc5ecc2

 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 designed for use with GNOME 3.  It tries to follow the Gnome Human
 Interface Guidelines as much as possible.  If the X Window System is
 not active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There
 are sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other
 tool kits.

Description-en: strips translations and alters maintainers during build
 pkgbinarymangler consists of a dpkg-deb wrapper that calls the following
 helper applications while building a debian binary package:
 .
 pkgstriptranslations removes all *.mo files in /usr/share/locale from
 all package build directories. It is used to strip off gettext translations
 from generated binary packages, because translations are already shipped
 in the language packs.  Its behaviour (which is disabled by default) is
 configured in /etc/pkgbinarymangler/striptranslations.conf.
 .
 pkgmaintainermangler adjusts the maintainer field in binary packages to
 match a set of rules (including whitelists, mass renames by component,
 maintainer name, etc) defined in the pkgmaintainermangler configuration
 file at /etc/pkgbinarymangler/maintainermangler.conf.

Description-en: policykit policy required to use plainbox (secure version)
 PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
 documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
 certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.
 .
 PlainBox can be used to both create simple and comprehensive test tools as
 well as to develop and execute test jobs and test scenarios. It was created as
 a refined and rewritten core of the Checkbox project. It has a well tested and
 documented core, small but active development community and a collection of
 associated projects that use it as a lower-level engine/back-end library.
 .
 PlainBox has a novel approach to discovering (and probing) hardware and
 software that is extensible and not hardwired into the system. It allows test
 developers to express association between a particular test and the hardware,
 software and configuration constraints that must be met for the test to
 execute meaningfully. This feature, along with pluggable test definitions,
 makes plainbox flexible and applicable to many diverse testing situations,
 ranging from mobile phones, traditional desktop computers, servers and up to
 testing "cloud" installations.
 .
 This package contains a PolicyKit .policy file that allows PlainBox to run
 plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 as root and ask for the user password only once
 per session.

 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "admin" or "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.

 This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.

Package: policyrcd-script-zg2
Description-md5: b8bbba679a71741ca48177c13074bc32
Description-en: policy-compliant interface from invoke-rc.d to local config files
 a script which is linked via the alternatives subsystem to
 /usr/sbin/update-rc.d. This script looks for a local policy-rc.d
 script in /usr/local and /etc, providing a policy- and FHS-compliant
 way to interface invoke-rc.d with a local script.
 .
 Without this package, a local admin wanting to cleanly interface with
 invoke-rc.d is forced to drop a local binary to /usr/sbin and/or
 manually interface with the alternatives system. Both ways of doing
 this are clumsy and error-prone, so this package offers a clean way of
 interfacing with sysvrc and file-rc.
 .
 Since there are at least two packages containing their own version of
 invoke-rc.d, having a search path policy for policy-rc.d can be
 messy and is prone to be unstructured and uncoordinated.
 .
 Hence, having a dedicated package is the clean way of doing things.
 .
 This package has its upstream sources maintained in the Debian
 project, so there is no upstream URL.

 not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
 put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript
 code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of
 the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 DPI to get the
 correct bounding box.

 A PSF font allows a maximum of 512 glyphs.  The glyph subset in this
 font includes ASCII, Latin-1, "oe" and "OE" ligatures for French, the
 Euro sign, Unicode Box Drawing, Unicode Block Elements, plus various
 glyphs for APL support and some other miscellaneous glyphs.  The font
 is monospaced, 8 pixels wide by 16 pixels tall.

Description-en: asynchronous Python 3 Bindings for Qt 5 (documentation)
 A Qt 5 QML Plugin that provides access to a Python 3 interpreter from QML.
 .
 PyOtherSide is a Qt 5 QML Plugin that provides access to a Python 3
 interpreter from QML. It was designed with mobile devices in mind, where
 high-framerate touch interfaces are common, and where the user usually
 interfaces only with one application at a time via a touchscreen. As such, it
 is important to never block the UI thread, so that the user can always
 continue to use the interface, even when the backend is processing,
 downloading or calculating something in the background.
 .
 At its core, PyOtherSide is basically a simple layer that converts Qt (QML)
 objects to Python objects and vice versa, with focus on asynchronous events
 and continuation-passing style function calls.
 .
 While legacy versions of PyOtherSide worked with Qt 4.x and Python 2.x, its
 focus now lies on Python 3.x and Qt 5. Python 3 has been out for several
 years, and offers some nice language features and clean-ups, while Qt 5
 supports most mobile platforms well, and has an improved QML engine and a
 faster renderer (Qt Scene Graph) compared to Qt 4.
 .
 This package provides the HTML documentation as well as the set of examples.

Package: python-django-pyscss
Description-md5: 66bae3bfd8f0c0797388ba756932c632
Description-en: makes it easier to use PySCSS in Django - Python 2.7
 Django-pyscss is a collection of tools for making it easier to use pyScss
 within Django. It overwrites the import system to use Django's staticfiles
 app. This way you can import SCSS files from any app (or any file that's
 findable by the STATICFILES_FINDERS) with no hassle. It provides a
 django-compressor precompile filter class so that you can easily use pyScss
 with django-compressor without having to bust out to the shell. This has the
 added benefit of removing the need to configure pyScss through its
 command-line arguments AND makes it possible for the exceptions and warnings
 that pyScss emits to bubble up to your process so that you can actually know
 what's going on.

Package: python-egenix-mxdatetime
Description-md5: e3102cb577c19b97097313b6b22ad8ea
Description-en: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy
 them and convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some
 other more esoteric values. In addition, there are several convenient
 constructors and formatters at hand to greatly simplify dealing with
 dates and times in real-world applications.
 .
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package
 also exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to
 build upon. This is especially interesting for database applications
 which often have to deal with date/time values (the mxODBC package is
 one example of an extension using this interface).
 .
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage
 formats, including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably
 most important, strings.
 .
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most
 flexible such parser available for Python. It is constantly being
 improved to make parsing date/time strings as easy as possible. At
 the same time, it offers a fully customizable interface which allows
 selecting valid date/time formats from a range of predefined
 categories.
 .
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO
 date/time formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet
 standards.

    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.

 This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.

 The appropriate implementation for ‘LockFile’ is chosen automatically
 based on the OS capabilities for an atomic filesystem operation.
 These implementations are also available for explicit use as
 ‘LinkLockFile’ and ‘MkdirLockFile’.
 .
 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics. Examples
 included are:
  * ‘SQLiteLockFile’, using records in an SQLite database.
  * ‘PIDLockFile’, using the semantics of a Unix PID file.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.

Description-en: tool to create, manipulate and study complex networks
 NetworkX is a Python-based package for the creation, manipulation, and
 study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
 .
 The structure of a graph or network is encoded in the edges (connections,
 links, ties, arcs, bonds) between nodes (vertices, sites, actors). If
 unqualified, by graph it's meant a simple undirected graph, i.e. no
 self-loops and no multiple edges are allowed. By a network it's usually
 meant a graph with weights (fields, properties) on nodes and/or edges.
 .
 The potential audience for NetworkX includes: mathematicians, physicists,
 biologists, computer scientists, social scientists.

Package: python-ply
Description-md5: ddbdacd0971bf7aaecde3faf56c83ece
Description-en: Lex and Yacc implementation for Python2
 PLY   is   yet  another   implementation   of   lex   and  yacc   for
 Python.  Although  several  other  parsing tools  are  available  for
 Python, there are  several reasons why you might want  to take a look
 at PLY:
  * It's implemented entirely in Python.
  * It uses  LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient  and well suited
    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,
    and support for ambiguous grammars.
  * PLY is  extremely easy  to use and  provides very  extensive error
    checking.

Package: python-rjsmin
Description-md5: 269753e1e0282f58d34e1c851174de91
Description-en: javascript minifier written in Python - Python 2.7
 rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in Python. The minifier is based on
 the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford.
 .
 The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
 runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
 same results as the original jsmin.c. It differs in the following ways:
 .
  - there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
    literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
  - Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
    are not converted to spaces (nor to)
  - Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
    for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
  - "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
  - Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
  - "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
  - Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
  - Comments starting with an exclamation mark (!) can be kept optionally
  - rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
    module provides a "streamy" interface).
 .
 Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
 than the original Python port of jsmin.c by Baruch Even. The speed factor
 varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and Python version (it gets
 faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
 speed-refactored Python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
 dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the
 docs/BENCHMARKS file for details.
 .

Package: python-scour
Description-md5: 868968918559d39d6a2c46d5345da067
Description-en: SVG scrubber and optimizer (Python 2 module)
 Scour is a Python module that aggressively cleans SVG files, removing a lot of
 unnecessary information that certain tools or authors embed into their
 documents.  The goal of scour is to provide an identically rendered image
 (i.e. a scoured document should have no discernable visible differences from
 the original file) while minimizing the file size.
 .
 WARNING: Scour is intended to be run on files that have been edited in Vector
 Graphics editors such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.  Scour attempts to
 optimize the file, and as result, it will change the file's structure and
 (possibly) its semantics.  If you have hand-edited your SVG files, you will
 probably not be happy with the output of Scour.
 .
 Never use scour to overwrite your original file!
 .
 This package also provides a dh_scour debhelper extension which optimizes all
 shipped SVGs during package build. If python-rsvg and python-cairo are
 available, it will also do a before/after comparison and discard the optimized
 image if they differ by more than 0.05%.

Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more

Description-md5: 0084b509d64d02182b09ca5a4a938417
Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - doc
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,

 module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
 recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
 node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
 usages.  They include some support for static inference and local name
 scopes.  Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
 objects.
 .
 Main modules are:
 .
   * `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
     different type of nodes of the tree.
 .
   * the `manager` contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
     source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
     constructed tree for quick access.

 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .

 A lazy object proxy is an object that wraps a callable but defers the call
 until the object is actually required, and caches the result of said call.
 .
 These kinds of objects are useful in resolving various dependency issues, few
 examples:
 .
  * Objects that need to held circular references at each other, but at
    different stages. To instantiate object Foo you need an instance of Bar.
    Instance of Bar needs an instance of Foo in some of it methods (but not at
    construction).  Circular imports sound familiar?
 .
  * Performance sensitive code. You don't know ahead of time what you're going
    to use but you don't want to pay for allocating all the resources at the
    start as you usually need just few of them.
 .

Description-md5: ab3e4e16d880158a692652f7aeb4779d
Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description-md5: 8c04b322fc21b52834676c8a9e0ed455
Description-en: manage dynamic plugins for Python applications - python3
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
 extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (plugins) at
 runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using
 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing

 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.

 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.

Description-md5: be0a368f981bee2d0afede3625221c9a
Description-en: asynchronous Python 3 Bindings for Qt 5 (QML plugin)
 A Qt 5 QML Plugin that provides access to a Python 3 interpreter from QML.
 .
 PyOtherSide is a Qt 5 QML Plugin that provides access to a Python 3
 interpreter from QML. It was designed with mobile devices in mind, where
 high-framerate touch interfaces are common, and where the user usually
 interfaces only with one application at a time via a touchscreen. As such, it
 is important to never block the UI thread, so that the user can always
 continue to use the interface, even when the backend is processing,
 downloading or calculating something in the background.
 .
 At its core, PyOtherSide is basically a simple layer that converts Qt (QML)
 objects to Python objects and vice versa, with focus on asynchronous events
 and continuation-passing style function calls.
 .
 While legacy versions of PyOtherSide worked with Qt 4.x and Python 2.x, its
 focus now lies on Python 3.x and Qt 5. Python 3 has been out for several
 years, and offers some nice language features and clean-ups, while Qt 5
 supports most mobile platforms well, and has an improved QML engine and a
 faster renderer (Qt Scene Graph) compared to Qt 4.
 .
 This package provides the QML plugin.

 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content

 Set and/or report the configuration information associated with
 a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and which IRQ
 a particular serial port is using.

 If you have other serial ports (such as an AST Fourport card), or
 if you have mapped the IRQs differently (perhaps COM3 and 4 to other
 IRQs to allow concurrent access with COM1 and 2) then you must have this
 package.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - account server
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: t1utils
Description-md5: abf1d47b8ca1b485d148651358fc9283
Description-en: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

 things like set the hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display
 and set the fan speed without the help of the kernel.
 Toshset requires an experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel module
 with an ACPI-enabled kernel. Otherwise it works only if the laptop supports
 the old APM BIOS. (The last of these was produced something like 5 years ago)
 Please read README.Debian how to install the experimental version of the
 toshiba_acpi kernel module. (Ubuntu users don't need it)
 .
 This package also includes the Toshsat1800-irdasetup by Daniele Peri.  It
 can be used to configure IrDA for laptops with ALI1533 bridge (LPC47N227
 SuperIO), smc-ircc and not initializing BIOS (tested on Toshiba Satellite
 1800-514).  Homepage: http://www.csai.unipa.it/peri/toshsat1800-irdasetup/

Description-en: TrueType version of GNU Unifont
 This contains two fonts: "Unifont" and "Unifont Sample".
 .
 unifont.ttf is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType
 outline font, Unifont.  Each pixel in the original bitmap font
 is represented as an outlined square.  The font provides a glyph
 for each visible code point (character) in the Unicode Basic
 Multilingual Plane (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the
 world's modern writing scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 unifont_sample.ttf is an SBIT font that contains combining circles
 and is therefore suitable for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs.
 unifont.ttf does not contain combining circles and so is suitable
 for general-purpose writing.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Description-en: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Package: unifont
Description-md5: bc02473fe540e171d0d8ad406484d498
Description-en: font with a glyph for each visible Unicode Plane 0 character
 This package is a convenient way to install both the PCF bitmap
 version and the scalable TrueType outline version of "Unifont"
 (intended for general-purpose use) and "Unifont Sample" (which contains
 combining circles to use for illustration purposes).  It also installs
 a copy of unifont.hex and related files in /usr/share/unifont.
 .
 GNU Unifont was designed to render something besides an empty box
 for each visible Unicode character in the Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing
 scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet

 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 and so is suited for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs, whereas
 Unifont is intended for general-purpose writing.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind Unifont, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size and has proper combining
 character support.

Package: xfonts-utils
Description-md5: cfb627fb99a0d0ef5d7b0b2f94423328
Description-en: X Window System font utility programs

 System that are needed for font management.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts

Package: xfsdump
Description-md5: 8448ced317c37d3587808bf000f24a98
Description-en: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

Description-en: X.Org X server -- VMMouse input driver to use with VMWare
 This package provides the driver for the X11 vmmouse input device.
 .
 The VMMouse driver enables support for the special VMMouse protocol
 that is provided by VMware virtual machines to give absolute pointer
 positioning.
 .
 The vmmouse driver is capable of falling back to the standard "mouse"
 driver if a VMware virtual machine is not detected. This allows for
 dual-booting of an operating system from a virtual machine to real hardware
 without having to edit xorg.conf every time.
 .

Package: xterm
Description-md5: c1e47d60a01948be9aae7a2a4f63a0fe
Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Package: zerofree
Description-md5: e8c47b284082ddf9145a003c9cbeafdb
Description-en: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").

 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use on ARM
 systems with UEFI.  It will not automatically install GRUB as the active
 boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade, so most
 people should install grub-efi-arm instead.

Package: mkvmlinuz
Description-md5: 57f7c14f19468fc52304fe4ab153e8b1
Description-en: create a kernel to boot a PowerPC machine from Open Firmware
 This little program takes a PowerPC Linux kernel as an uncompressed
 ELF image file (usually called vmlinux or such) and adds boot code
 and possibly a ramdisk to create a compressed kernel image that
 can be booted directly from Open Firmware, thus eliminating the
 need for a second-stage bootloader such as yaboot or quik. This is
 especially useful on PowerPC sub-architectures which do not have a
 bootloader at all, but may also come in handy for install kernels,
 netboot systems, and the like.
